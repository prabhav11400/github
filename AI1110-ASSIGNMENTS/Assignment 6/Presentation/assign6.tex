	Show that if S consists of a countable number of elements $ \zeta  $ and each subset ($ \zeta $) is an event, 
	then all subsets of S are events.

	\section{Solution}
	\begin{frame}{Solution}
		Since S contains countable number of elements ,therefore Any subset of S will contain a finite number of elements. Hence, it(each subset) 
		can be written as a countable union of elementary events or sample points . So it is clear that all subsets of S will be an event.
