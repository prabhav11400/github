A man invests Rs 4500 in shares of a company which is paying 7.5% dividend. If Rs 100 shares are available at a discount of 10%, find:
(i) the number of shares he purchases
(ii) his annual income

int numberOfShares(double investment, double faceValue, double discount);
double annualIncome(double investment, double dividend, double discount);

int main() {
    double P = 4500.0;    // Total investment made by the man
    double F = 100.0;     // Face value of a share
    double d = 10.0;      // Discount at which the shares are available
    double D = 7.5;       // Dividend

    // Output
    printf("The man purchased %d shares\n", numberOfShares(P, F, d));
    printf("The annual income of the man is Rs %.2lf\n", annualIncome(P, D, d));
